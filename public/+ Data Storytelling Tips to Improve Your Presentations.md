- [[00:32]] Data by itself is dirty and your responsibility as the presenter is to give meaning to it.

- [[01:00]] Never present a single number, give the historical performance of the same company or the industry in general

- [[01:48]] Every table should have only one focal point 

- [[02:56]] Add color contrast in graphs.Use the same colour palette and criteria doing them 

- [[06:08]] Use a waterfall chart when we present a few numbers 

- [[06:31]] Use stickers in PowerPoint to signal the current state of every slide.
